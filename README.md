# Background

*Note* This was my very first time trying out ReactJS and I really fell in love.

When I was looking for work years back I started this as a portfolio website. I found a job way before finishing this. Now I am looking for work again I am going to redo this correctly and put in more than a few hours.

I wanted to be able to use the website as if it was a console feature to:
 - download my resume
 - shoot me an email, etc.

I also wanted to be able to dynamically add commands to the console through the backend API.
Years of experience with reactJS later, I think I can make this pretty cool.

### Forgive the animations, they are smooth in real life, but I had to turn a a 16mb gif into 2 by reducing frame rate.
