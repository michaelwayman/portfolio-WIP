# Background

*Note* This was my very first time trying out ReactJS and I really fell in love.

When I was looking for work years back I was going to make a website to act as my resume/portfolio.
I found a job within days had forgot all about this. Now that I am looking for work again I might start it over and put more than just the few hours into it than what is currently here.

I wanted to be able to use the website as if it was a console feature to:
 - download my resume and such.
 - Navigate pages
 - browse a sandboxed file-system
 - switch users

I also wanted to be able to add commands through the backend that could be dynamically added.

Now that I am looking for work again I might actually put some time into this one, knowing what I know now vs being a first timer with react.
